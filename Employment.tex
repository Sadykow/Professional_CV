	% Accumulator Battery Management System to measure current, Voltage, and temperature to determine the State of Charge (SoC) as part of the Master of Philosophy research. In addition, research and integration embedded devices, capable of running Machine Learning model on a low-power electric grid using TPU-accelerator and Sparkfun TPU powered devices or R-pi3 w/ custom HAT CAN to Wi-Fi module.
	\newline
	\newline
	The research involved implementing several published versions of the estimating SoC, respecting source implementation against the defined research metrics, and training over dozens of datasets for cross-correlated performance measurement with the best set of hyper-parameters determined over similar trials. Over 150 models were trained in parallel and recorded to the ClickHouse database to compare against the novel implementation involving enhanced training procedures and later performance tested on low-power devices.
