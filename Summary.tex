\small \textbf{Additionally, worked with Unix-based operation systems on a systems level through a personal interest in kernel patching, virtualisation and open-source library support. Participated in the development of nightly features, like Tensorflow 2.4 Attention layers before official integration and RoAdam optimiser in search of ways to improve the Time-Series model for MPhil research. Ended up writing a custom training procedure from the first principal to accommodate the novel approach to the model training.}

\textbf{Developed understanding in a variety of Algorithms (Searching and Sorting), Machine Learning using TensorFlow (Implemented a large functional library of useful methods C code wrappers to Python to increase performance during research, involving optimisation and parallel multi-GPU computation),
and Cloud programming with AWS for data storage and processing.
Mastered common known operational systems (OSs) through Xen and QEMU/KVM para and nested virtualisation.}
